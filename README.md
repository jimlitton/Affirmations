My exercise with the Google RecyclerView codelab to learn about handling large dynamic list with 
plans to fix a bug in a app at work. Also with plans to do an integration with my just for fun app, 
which is sometimes public, sometimes private, android-scratch.pad, and its to do list,
for repetitive learning.

Focus music:
  I listened to some trance coding music when working through the labs:

... I feel so affirmed after these inspirational codelabs
